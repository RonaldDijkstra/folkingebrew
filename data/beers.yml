  description: "Hop in the Yard is a double dry-hopped New England style IPA, inspired by the IPAs of the American east coast.  The beer is intensely dry-hopped with 20 grams of Citra and Mosaic per liter. The amount of hops causes a taste explosion. The combination of Mosaic and Citra gives the beer a fruity hoppy character, beautiful citrus tones and lots of tropical fruit. A small bitter stands up against the tropical flavors and the used oat flakes provide a creamy mouthfeel.  SPECS:  ABV: 6,9% IBU: 35 Hops: Citra & Mosaic Yeast: WLP066 London Fog Ale  Brewed at Rock City Brewing (Amersfoort, NL)."

  description: "Double IPA, Double Dry-Hopped with Citra, Mosaic and Nelson Sauvin. Thanks to Nelson Sauvin and a specific yeast strain this beer is on the dry side with just a little bit of a white wine character. The ABV isn't really noticeable and is hidden behind a huge flavour."
