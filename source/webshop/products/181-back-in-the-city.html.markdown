The third beer in our investor collab series was brewed together with Robbert Olinga and Maurits van der Boon, two passionate home brewers. They brought ideas, energy and a shared love for hops into the brewday!

We used Nelson Sauvin Cryo in both the mash (that’s a first for us!) and whirlpool and dry hopped it massively with again Nelson Sauvin, Nectaron and Riwaka. Expect layers of white grape, peach candy, lime zest and soft tropical fruit, wrapped in a malt base of oats, wheat and pils, with a touch of red malt adding colour and depth.
