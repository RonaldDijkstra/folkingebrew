Go With the Flow is a crisp 5.5% New Zealand-style pilsner brewed with pilsner malt, flaked wheat and WHCâ€™s Apres Ski yeast for a dry, clean finish. Nelson Sauvin, Motueka, Pacific Jade and Riwaka hops layer lime, white grape, gooseberry and a gentle herbal lift, making it perfect for sunny Indian-summer afternoons.
