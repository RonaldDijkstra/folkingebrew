After a long-standing connection and a packed Tap Take Over with Elliot in town, it was time to turn that history into a collaboration. The result is a hazy DIPA at 8.5%, loaded with Citra Cryo, Simcoe Cryo and Superdelic, delivering a hop-forward, tropical and soft profile that fits both breweries perfectly.
