A big mix of Citra Cryo, Cryo Pop, Strata and El Dorado plus a hit of Abstrax Brewgas Blue Dream turns Army of Four into a hazy DIPA loaded with tropical fruit, blueberry candy notes and a bold kush driven edge. Brewed together with Hop Hooligans, Baxbier and Maktoob it is loud, juicy and full of character!
