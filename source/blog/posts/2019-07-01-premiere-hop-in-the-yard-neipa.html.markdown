Last Sunday, June 30, our newest beer Hop in the Yard had its premiere. The first Hop in the Yard cask was hit during the BBQ x IPA of Bierlokaal Café De Koffer in Groningen.

## What kind of beer is Hop in the Yard?
Hop in the Yard is a double dry-hopped New England style IPA, inspired by the IPAs we know so well from the American East Coast.

## New England IPA
A New England IPA is a thick, juicy beer. It is best defined by its hazy appearance. The beer is hazy because it is not filtered like other beers. These IPAs are often double dryhopped - hops are added twice during the main fermentation - adding to the haze and fruity aroma. Connoisseurs of all ages will love these hazy IPAs because they have beautiful floral and citrusy notes from the hops, a smooth, creamy texture, and they are less bitter than other types of IPAs.

## Hop in the Yard
Hop in the Yard is intensely (double) dryhopped with 20 grams of Citra and Mosaic per liter. This large amount of hops creates a true taste explosion. The combination of Mosaic and Citra gives the beer a fruity hoppy character, beautiful citrus notes and lots of tropical fruit. A little bitterness provides sufficient counteracting, the oat flakes provide a creamy mouthfeel.
