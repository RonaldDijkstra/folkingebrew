Folkingebrew was founded with the aim of brewing beer that we like to drink ourselves. That is why we make beers with a distinct character in taste, aroma and color.

Because of our passion for good beer, we try to get a little better with every beer and push our boundaries.

Folkinge, the first part of our name, refers to the location where we started brewing: in the 'backyard' of a beer shop on the Folkingestraat in Groningen. Brew refers to the American craft beer culture, where we get our inspiration.
