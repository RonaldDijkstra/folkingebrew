Like many others, we are beer geeks who turned brewer, because of our love for the great, versatile product that is beer. We love to drink big, bold beer with profound aromas and flavors and naturally that's what we brew.

We are active since the end of 2017. Since then we are continuously brewing small test batches and if we are satisfied we try to brew them as good as possible at rental brewers.

Our ambition is to start our own brewery and we are working towards that goal every single day. We are growing with almost every release, so what started as just a 250 liter release back in 2018, is now approximately 3000 liters per beer. It's been great fun!

## What's in a name?

Folkinge, the first part of our name, refers to the location where we started brewing: in the 'backyard' of a beer shop in the Folkingestraat in Groningen. Brew refers to the American craft beer culture, where we mostly get our inspiration.
