## Package Missing?

Review your Track & Trace, which you received from us by email. If the status of the Track & Trace has not changed for four working days, please contact us at webshop@folkingebrew.nl. We will then contact PostNL.

If your tracking hasn't been updated for more than 30 days we cannot start an investigation with PostNL anymore, so please contact us before that! If you contact us about a missing order after 30 days, we can't give you a refund, because PostNL can't investigate and therefore won't compensate us.

## Return Policy

You have the right to return your package and terminate the contract for a period of 14 days after the purchase. The costs for returning the package are yours. If you you want to return your beers or other products, please send an e-mail to webshop@folkingebrew.nl. We will send you a confirmation email with instructions. If the return shipment has been checked by us and is found to be in good condition, you will be refunded for the beers and/or other products you returned.
