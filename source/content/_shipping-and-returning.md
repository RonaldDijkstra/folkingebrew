But if your track & trace has not changed for over four working days, please contact us immediately at webshop@folkingebrew.nl. We have a 30 day time window at PostNL for starting an investigation. After that refunds are not possible.

You have the right to return your package for a period of 14 days after the purchase. The costs for returning the package are yours. In order to return your beers and/or other products, please send an email to webshop@folkingebrew.nl. We'll send you instructions.
