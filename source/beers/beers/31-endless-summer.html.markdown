It’s that time of year again. Long days and warm nights awaken the city. The list of festivals is endless. Have you ever wondered what it would be like if summer lasted forever?

We tried to mimic that feeling with this summery New England IPA of ‘only’ 7.5%! Because we used a highly tropical mix of Strata, Citra and Sabro hops, this refreshing hazy beer begins with a profound fruity, tropical aroma and taste before a slight wave of bitterness rounds it all off. We chose the Fruit Bowl yeast, as it’s fruity ester profile fits the hazy style perfectly.
