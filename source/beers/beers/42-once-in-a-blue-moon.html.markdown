We've gone all out with the hops on this one, combining the unique and complex flavors of Nelson Sauvin and Sabro with the classic citrus punch of Citra. The result is a beer that is perfectly balanced with notes of passionfruit, coconut and grapefruit, all complemented by a gentle bitterness that lingers on the tongue.
