The first beer in this series can be nothing other than a tribute to one of our most beloved and often used hop varieties: Nelson Sauvin. This variant therefore shows the unique characteristics of Nelson Sauvin! This hop gives a white wine grape-like flavor to beer. Other well-known descriptions include extreme fruitiness, passion fruit and “freshly ground gooseberries”.
