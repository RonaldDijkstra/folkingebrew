The harmonious marriage of mango, raspberry and blackberry offers a fresh twist on our smoothie concept, creating a brew that's both visually and tastefully rich. Just like the first edition, the massive amount of fruits ensure a real smoothie experience which captures the essence of each fruit. The pils malt, oat and wheat blend serves as the canvas upon which these flavors come to life. And, of course, weâ€™re utilizing US-05 yeast for its approachable character and lactobacillus for a touch of tartness.
