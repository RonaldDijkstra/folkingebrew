This beer is a tribute both to our 50th release milestone and our beloved home city of Groningen. With a nod to our heritage, we've gone all out to bring you an exceptional beer that perfectly reflects our journey so far.

During the hot side, we've infused the brew with Nelson Sauvin and Cryo Pop hops, setting the stage for a dynamic flavor profile. As the cold stage arrives, we've continued the infusion using the same hops and adding Motueka into the mix. This combination results in an explosion of tropical aromas and flavors.
