This Sour Berliner Weisse is inspired by a pancake breakfast, as the combination of blueberries, maple syrup, and vanilla create a similar taste profile to a traditional pancake breakfast. The fruity sweetness of the blueberries, the rich woody flavor of the maple syrup, and the subtle creaminess of the vanilla all come together to create a beer that is both tart and sweet, with a complex array of flavors that is sure to please the palate.
