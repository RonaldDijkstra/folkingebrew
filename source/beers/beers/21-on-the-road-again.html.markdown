For the hop blend of this beer (NEDIPA, 8.2%) we opted for large amounts of Idaho 7 and Mosaic, supported by Citra T90 in the whirlpool and dry hop.
This creates an in your face explosion of scents and flavors of tropical fruit. For the malt bill, we’ve used wheat, together with low colour Golden Promise and pilsner malt. The beer is fermented with London Fog, one of the go-to strains for New England Style IPA’s.
