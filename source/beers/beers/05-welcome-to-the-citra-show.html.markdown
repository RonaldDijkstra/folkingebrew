Welcome to the Citra Show is a New England Style DIPA (8.5%) and is double dry hopped with Citra. This allows the unique properties of Citra to come into its own exceptionally well. It gives this beer a nice flavor profile of citrus and tropical fruit.
We also used a good dose of oats and added a touch of lactose for that silky smooth mouthfeel that New England Style IPAs are so famous for.
