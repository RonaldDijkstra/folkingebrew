The Syndicate is a Hazy Double IPA and is the second beer in our ongoing investor collaboration series. This time we teamed up with Pikgroep, a group of friends who joined forces to invest in Folkingebrew. The idea behind the beer was shaped together and it turned into something weâ€™re really proud of!
