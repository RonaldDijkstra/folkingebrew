This one’s a collab with 3 Sons Brewing from Dania Beach, Florida. We’re very proud to work with such a world renowned brewery. It’s a real honor to put something together with a team so focused on quality, creativity and flavor. Brewing this one together was all good vibes, start to finish. The result is Good Vibes Only, an Oat Cream DIPA that leans into softness and clean hop expression.
