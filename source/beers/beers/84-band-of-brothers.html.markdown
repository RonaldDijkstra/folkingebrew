Band of Brothers is the first in a series of upcoming investor collaborations. Brewed with Wouter IJsselstein, this 10% Hazy TIPA was developed together from start to finish. The result is punchy, saturated and cleanly built, with a big hop bill and a soft, steady malt base.

Citra Cryo and Cryopop in the whirlpool bring loads of mango, peach candy and lime zest. For the double dry hop, we added more Citra Cryo and Cryopop, plus Eclipse for a boost of mandarin, deep citrus and a touch of pine. Bold but balanced, the hop profile lands exactly where we wanted it.

Full of flavor without going over the top, this is classic Hazy TIPA territory. Built with care, brewed together and perfect for sharing!
