In this juicy New England DIPA (8.6%) we used no less than 3 different Citra products: T90, Incognito and Yakima Chiefâ€™s new Trial 301 Citra. The latter combines the concept of fresh frozen hops with cryo technology. This allows us to use frozen fresh hops during the cold side of the brewing process. Because of that, all the magic aromas of fresh hops blast out this beer!  Citra is combined with Galaxy and BRU-1, so expect a lot of citrus, peach and passion fruit in aroma and taste. To bring all different elements together, we chose WHC Juice Machine yeast for the fermentation, a blend of yeasts that produces delicate citrus, apricot and grapefruit esters, perfect for the hazy style.
