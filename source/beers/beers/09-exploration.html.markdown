We like to explore our boundaries and often try to cross them. Therefore, our new beer Exploration, a New England Style DIPA of 8.2% ABV, is intensely double dry-hopped with Azacca, Mosaic and Galaxy. The hop blend creates an â€“ in your face - tropical fruit explosion. For this beer, we have chosen to ferment it with London Ale III, a yeast that is a great fit for the New England Style job. In addition, we used a big dose of oats once again for that silky smooth mouthfeel.
