This variant celebrates the renowned trio of Citra, Mosaic and Galaxy. Known for its powerful tropical profile, Galaxy hops take center stage with flavors of ripe peach, passionfruit, and zesty citrus. The beerâ€™s soft, hazy body (thanks to a blend of Golden Promise malt, oats, and wheat) makes the juicy tropical notes pop.
