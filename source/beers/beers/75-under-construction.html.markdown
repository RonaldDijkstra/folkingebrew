This signature hazy DIPA (8.5%) is packed with bold flavors from carefully chosen and personal favourite hops. Citra Cryo and Azacca in the whirlpool bring bright hits of mango and citrus, while Nelson Sauvin Cryo, more Azacca, and extra Citra Cryo in the dry hop add notes of white grape, gooseberry, and stone fruit. A soft malt bill of pilsner malt, wheat, and oats ties it all together with a smooth, pillowy finish.
