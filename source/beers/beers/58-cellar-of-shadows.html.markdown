Cellar of Shadows has a robust, thick base, made from a blend of light malts and an array of dark malts, including the rich complexity of chocolate malt. Fermented with the trusted US-05 yeast, this beer is a testament to our commitment to quality.

After fermentation we added coconut and cocoa to put a twist on the flavor profile. These additions bring notes of tropical sweetness and velvety richness, creating a balanced and enjoyable drinking experience.
