This collab with Moersleutel Craft Brewery is a New England Style TIPA of 9.5% ABV. Itâ€™s double dry hopped with Citra, Nelson Sauvin, Idaho 7 and Ekuanot. The pillowy soft backbone consists of Golden Promise and oats. For fermentation, Unlocked marks the return of one our favorite yeasts: Vermont.
