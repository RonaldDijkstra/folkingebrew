The banana adds a mellow, ripe sweetness that leans into smoothie territory, while the passion fruit cuts through with sharp acidity and floral citrus notes. It’s a layered flavor profile that’s creamy, tart and tropical all at once. Lactose rounds off the edges, adding body and a touch of sweetness to soften the sourness.
