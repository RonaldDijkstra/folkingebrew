Some things take time, like building a brewery of our own or finally brewing the Pilsner we’ve had in mind for a long time.
Work in Progress is more than just a name, it’s a reflection of the long road we’ve taken to get here. And what better way to celebrate than with a true-to-style Czech Pilsner. Decoction mashed, hopped with noble Saaz and patiently lagered for six weeks to bring out its crisp and clean perfection.
