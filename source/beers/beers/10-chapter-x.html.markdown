Chapter X is intensely double dryhopped with Citra, Mosaic and one of our personal favorite hops: Nelson Sauvin. This hop blend creates an explosion of tropical fruit and notes of, among other things, white grape.

The beer is fermented with London Ale III, a yeast that goes well with the New England Style TIPA. In addition to an already thick base of Golden Promise malt, we used a good dose of oats for that silky soft mouthfeel.
