For this release we wanted to do something big, so we came up with our heaviest beer yet. This is Out of Space, a New England Style TIPA that clocks in at 10% ABV.

In this hoppy banger we used both Citra and Mosaic in Incognito variant. The double dry hop charge of Citra, Mosaic, Galaxy and Sabro creates a versatile mix of different tropical flavours. We fermented the beer with one of our favorite yeast strains: Vermont.
