Under the Southern Sky is a New England Style Double IPA of 8.1%, in which we only used New Zealand hops. For this beer we managed to get hold of a unique hop variety: Riwaka!

This (still) relatively unknown and hard to get variety has a character of passion fruit, citrus and grapefruit. We are happy to be able to work with this! The blend of Riwaka with Nelson Sauvin and Motueka makes this beer a real New Zealand special. In addition, we use Golden Promise malt and a good dose of oats, which contribute to the silky soft body.
