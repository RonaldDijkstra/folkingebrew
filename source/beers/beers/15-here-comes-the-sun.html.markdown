Better times are ahead and summer is almost upon us! That’s why we named this hopped up creation Here Comes The Sun.

For Here Comes The Sun (NEDIPA, 8.2%) we used an incognito variant as whirlpool hop for the first time: Mosaic Incognito. On top of that, this hazy DIPA is intensely double dry-hopped with Eclipse, Galaxy and Mosaic. The combination of Golden Promise and oats creates a silky soft base. For the fermentation we used Verdant’s beautiful IPA yeast.
