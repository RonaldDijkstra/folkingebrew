During the whirlpool stage, we've combined Nelson Sauvin and Citra Cryo hops to deliver a balanced bitterness, that adds an extra layer of depth. The cold side, however, is where the real alchemy occurs. Through a triple dryhop addition of Eclipse, Nelson Sauvin and Citra Cryo, we've orchestrated a medley of fruity flavors that interacts harmoniously on your palate.
