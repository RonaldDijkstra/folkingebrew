Hopped with Citra Cryo, Simcoe Cryo and Galaxy, this beer bursts with ripe mango, passionfruit and juicy peach, layered with hints of orange zest. The well known combination of pilsner malt, wheat and oats creates a soft, rounded body that holds it all together, while London Ale III yeast ties everything into a vibrant, fruit-forward experience.
