This one means a lot. Welcome to The Pub celebrates the opening of our very own space, a comfortable bar where everything we do finally has a front door. To mark the moment, we brewed a signature 7.5% Hazy IPA that is soft, saturated and full of expressive hop character. The label is a nod to Welcome to the Citra Show, one of our first can releases, connecting the early days to where we are now.

Now let’s talk about the beer. Whirlpool additions of Citra Cryo and Mosaic bring familiar notes of citrus, mango and overripe pineapple. The dry hop adds more of the same, with a bump from Krush, a new hop for us, layering in soft mandarin, guava and a bit of floral lift. LAIII rounds it out with peachy fermentation esters and that signature haze.

A Hazy IPA that’s all about flow. We’ll be pouring this one fresh at The Pub, hope to see you there!
