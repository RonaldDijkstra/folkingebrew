Step into the darkest hour and embrace the bold flavors of our second official imperial stout release: Enter the Night! This indulgent beer (12% ABV) is brewed with carefully selected malts and complemented by decadent adjuncts added after fermentation.

The malt bill includes pilsner malt, roasted malt, chocolate malt, oats and wheat, resulting in a velvety mouthfeel that is the canvas for the adjuncts. After primary fermentation, we added generous amounts of coconut, hazelnut and cocoa nibs. The coconut provides a tropical aroma and flavor, while the hazelnut adds a toasty and nutty character that blends perfectly with the chocolate notes from the cocoa nibs.
