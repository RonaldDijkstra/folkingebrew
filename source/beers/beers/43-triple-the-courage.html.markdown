To create Triple the Courage, we again used a combination of wheat and oats in the malt bill, along with Belgian Wit yeast and London Fog yeast for fermentation. This unique blend of yeasts provides a base profile of banana and spices, with a hazy appearance so characteristic for the New England style.
