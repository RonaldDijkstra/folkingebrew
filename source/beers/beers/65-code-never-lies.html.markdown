Code Never Lies features a mix of hops that deliver vibrant flavors of tropical and stone fruits. The whirlpool addition of Nelson Sauvin (cryo) and El Dorado brings forward bright notes of white grape, pineapple, and passion fruit, with a hint of citrus peel. During dry hopping, Riwaka, extra Nelson Sauvin (cryo), and extra El Dorado enhance the aromatic profile, adding layers of fresh fruit in both aroma and flavor.
