We’ve brewed hazy DIPAs in a lot of shapes and forms but this one’s a little different. Tranquility (8.5%) is our take on a Hazy White DIPA, fermented with a blend of Belgian Wit yeast and LAIII. It’s soft, rounded and just a bit spicy in all the right ways.

The base is built with Golden Promise, wheat and oats, creating a smooth body for the hops to sit on. Nelson Sauvin Cryo and Citra Cryo go into the whirlpool followed by a double dry hop of El Dorado, more Nelson Sauvin and more Citra Cryo. Expect bright white grape, lime, ripe pear and some candied tropicals layered without being over the top.
