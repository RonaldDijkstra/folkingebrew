Weâ€™ve designed Smoothie Sequence #1 to capture the essence of tropical fruits. The sweet tang of mango, the aromatic intensity of passion fruit and the delicate pulpiness of peach come together in harmony. The foundation of pils malt, oat and wheat provides a balanced backdrop. To achieve a signature touch of tartness, we've used lactobacillus. Meanwhile, the approachable character of US-05 yeast ensures a pleasant drinking experience. And with a modest 5% ABV, it's an invitation to enjoy these flavors at your leisure!
