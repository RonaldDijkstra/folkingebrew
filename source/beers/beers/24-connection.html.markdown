This New England Style TIPA is a collab with both Atelier VRAI and Blech.brut. It clocks in at 9.5% ABV and is hopped up big time in both the whirlpool and dry hop with personal favorite Nelson Sauvin and the Cryo Pop blend. In the dry hop we used Motueka too. This expressive melange delivers aromas and flavors of tropical fruit, stone fruits and citrus.

To make it smooth and hazy we used generous amounts of oats and wheat in the malt bill. We chose Verdantâ€™s wonderful IPA yeast for fermentation, to make sure the end result would not be too sweet for our taste buds. And yours of course!
