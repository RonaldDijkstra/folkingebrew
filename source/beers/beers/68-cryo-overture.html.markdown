A hazy triple IPA (10%) that hits all the right notes, with the vibrant flavors of cryo hops taking center stage. The whirlpool addition of Talus and Citra brings out layers of bright grapefruit, juicy mango, and subtle floral notes, while dry hopping with those same hops, along with Ekuanot, adds depth with hints of green pepper and papaya.
