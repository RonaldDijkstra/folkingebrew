The hop blend for this hoppy beast consists of generous amounts of the beautiful Southern Hemisphere hops Motueka and Enigma, together with a decent amount of ‘good old’ Citra. This blend provides tastes and aromas of white grape, red currant, tropical fruits and citrus, backed by a slight grapefruit-esque bitterness. The use of oats and wheats in the malt bill makes sure we get a pillowy soft beer, which supports the hop blend very well. To bring all different elements together in a synergistic way, we chose to use the well known Verdant IPA yeast, perfect for brewing a less sweet New England style beer.
