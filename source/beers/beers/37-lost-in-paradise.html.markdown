This beer is in the signature style we are known for: Lost in Paradise is a hazy New England IPA (7.5%). The hop blend consists of three of our favorite varieties: Nelson Sauvin, Galaxy and Citra. The malt bill consists of regular pilsner malt, along with substantial amounts of oats and wheat. We chose the new Tropical Paradise yeast for fermentation, specially selected for beers with a high body and fullness.
