This beer is executed in our signature New England Double IPA style: low colour golden promise, pilsner malt, oats and wheat for the malt bill and a large amount of hops for the double dry hop. The blend consists of Strata, Citra and Eclipse. Citra provides the citrus and earthy undertones and Strata and Eclipse provide a layered mix of tropical fruits (mango, passion fruit, melon). For the fermentation we went back to 'good old' Vermont, still one of our favorite yeasts to work with!
