Since this is our 25th release we almost immediately thought to do a ‘classic’ hop combination for New England style IPAs.

That’s why this New England Style DIPA (8%) is generously double dry hopped with two of our favorite hazy style hops: Galaxy and Mosaic. This duo complements each other well as some of the more tropical, punchy hops available. For smoothness and haziness we use a good dose of oats and wheat. London Fog contributes to the velvety mouthfeel and supports the hops beautifully with its ester profile. Expect aromas and flavors of citrus, peach, mango and passion fruit in your glass!
