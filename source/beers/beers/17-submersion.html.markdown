This is Submersion, a New England Style DIPA (8.5%). For the creation of this beer we dived deep and shaped up a lively, yet balanced blend of 4 different hop varieties.

During the whirlpool we used Citra Incognito, among others. On top of that, the beer was double dry hopped with Citra, BRU-1, Vic Secret and El Dorado. The malt profile consists of Golden Promise and various oats, which contribute to the full-bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Everything is brought together in a fruity, juicy way by the awesome London Ale III yeast.
