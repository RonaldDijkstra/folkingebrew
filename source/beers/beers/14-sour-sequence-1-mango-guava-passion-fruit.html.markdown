This is Sour Sequence #1, our very first fruited imperial berliner weisse, a style that we are a big fan of.

The thick and sour berliner weisse base (8.5% ABV) is conditioned on hefty amounts of mango, guava and passion fruit. Because of those fruits it pours a deep and hazy orange-yellow color, with an intense fruit explosion in your glass.
