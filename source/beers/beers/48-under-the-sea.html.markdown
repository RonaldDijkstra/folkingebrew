We combine Cascade and Strata hops for the whirlpool, adding subtle citrus and pine notes. The use of Strata, Citra, El Dorado and Talus hops during the dry hopping phase creates a symphony of juicy fruitiness. Waves of mango, passion fruit and citrus dance over your tongue and provide a refreshing and tropical experience.
