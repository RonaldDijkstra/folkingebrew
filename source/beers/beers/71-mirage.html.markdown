This beer combines the tart juiciness of ripe blackberry and peach with the vibrant hop character of Citra and Nelson Sauvin. This Sour IPA walks the line between fruity flavors and tropical hop aromas, with a touch of lactose for extra smoothness.

Pilsner malt, wheat and oats form the silky base, while the fruit additions give the beer a sweetness that is balanced by the soft peach finish. The hops contribute layers of passion fruit, gooseberry and citrus peel, enhancing all the flavor elements.
