Crafted with attention to detail, Dreamscape (8.5% ABV) is a manifestation of our passion for beer and brewing. We begin by infusing Simcoe hops during the whirlpool stage. Imparting a burst of pine and citrus, this creates a solid foundation. As the journey continues, we unleash the combination of Nelson Sauvin and Citra hops during the dry hopping. These hops intertwine harmoniously, creating a vibrant blend of tropical fruit flavors, zesty citrus notes and undertones reminiscent of white wine.
