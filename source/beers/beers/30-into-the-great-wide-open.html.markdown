This is a collab with Latvian craft beer power house Ārpus Brewing Co.!

Like us, Ārpus is founded by true craft beer geeks out of love for beer. These amazing guys only brew what they love: juicy hop forward ales, fruity sours and big, bold imperial stouts. Needless to say, we think their approach to beer and brewing is an example and we are delighted to be able to make a collab with such a great brewery.

Ārpus means outside in Latvian, so we thought to do something in that regard for the branding of this one. Besides that, for this occasion, we figured to go all out and brew our heaviest, most hop forward beer to date! So Into the Great Wide Open clocks in at a whopping 10% and we used more hops than we ever did. The hop blend for this beast consists of personal favorites Nelson Sauvin, Mosaic, Galaxy and Cryo Citra, so expect full tropical, citrus aromas and flavors with a nice danky side. Famous New England style yeast LAIII is responsible for the fermentation and brings all components together in a powerful, yet balanced mix.
