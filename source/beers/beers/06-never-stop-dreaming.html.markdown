We did not hold back for this beer and we used no less than 4 different hops, including Sabro.

Never Stop Dreaming is a New England Style DIPA (8.7%). The hop blend for the double dry hop consists of the combination of Citra and Galaxy, supplemented with Sabro and Ekuanot for spectacular and surprising tropical flavors. Plus, weâ€™ve used a good dose of oats for a smooth mouthfeel. The beer is fermented with our favorite Vermont yeast.
