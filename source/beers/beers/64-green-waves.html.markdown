Green Waves contains a symphony of hops that together deliver rich flavors of citrus and tropical fruit. The whirlpool addition of Citra and Cryopop unleashes bursts of grapefruit, lime and passion fruit, complemented by subtle hints of peach and melon. During dry hopping, Motueka, extra Cryopop and extra Citra contribute aromatic complexity with notes of fresh citrus and a hint of earthy spice.
