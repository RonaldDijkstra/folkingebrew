For the second DIPA we go on a journey of discovery with another ‘southern hemisphere’ hop favorite of our brewers: Motueka. The first sips of this brew are characterized by a lively explosion of intense lime flavor, followed by hints of tropical fruit and invigorating citrus notes, especially the refreshing taste of lemon peel.
