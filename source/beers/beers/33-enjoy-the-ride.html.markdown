Cryo Pop contains all the hop properties we love to see, taste and smell in a New England DIPA. The blend consists of varieties that are best added during dry hopping, for an explosion in the senses. In the mix with Citra and El Dorado, this provides a popping hop aroma and flavors such as citrus, mango, pineapple and papaya, a hint of passion fruit and a little bit of creamy coconut. For the fermentation we chose the well-known London Fog, perfect for the New England style.
