This is a hazy New England Style DIPA (8.5%). We double dry hopped the beer with all time hop heroes Simcoe and Mosaic, together with Idaho 7 and El Dorado, in a bold yet balanced mix of tropical and resinous flavors.

For the malt bill we used low colour Golden Promise and a ferm dose of oats. We fermented the beer with LAIII, one of the great yeasts for hazies.
