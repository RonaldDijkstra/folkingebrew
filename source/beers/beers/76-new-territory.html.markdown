New Territory is a an American IPA (7% ABV) with classic west coast vibes with a fresh twist and is definately new territory for us in our brewing journey! Centennial and Chinook bring that familiar piney bitterness up front, while Simcoe in the whirlpool adds citrus zest and a touch of dankness. A dry hop of Citra, Simcoe and Chinook layers in bright grapefruit and ripe mango. Itâ€™s crisp, dry and leaves just the right amount of bite. The malt bill (Pilsner, Pearl Pale Ale, Chit Malt, and Carapils) keeps the body light and snappy, while WHC LAX yeast makes sure the hops stay in the spotlight.
