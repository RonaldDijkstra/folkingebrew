Reaching for the Stars is a New England Style IPA with 7% alcohol and is characterized by a strong, late dry-hopping with the blend of El Dorado, Mosaic and Citra hops. These hops provide flavors of tropical fruit, citrus, pineapple and mango and aromas of citrus, pear, watermelon and stone fruit. We also once again use a large amount of oats for the silky smooth mouthfeel that we like to see in our hazy IPAs.
