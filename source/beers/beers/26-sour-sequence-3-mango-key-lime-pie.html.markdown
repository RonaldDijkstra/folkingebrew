Mango key lime pie is a dessert pie made with mango, lime, egg yolks and sweetened milk. To bring these flavors into the beer, we have conditioned our typically sour Berliner Weisse base (8%) on large amounts of mango, lime, vanilla and lactose.

For the ‘crust’ effect, we added cardamom, which is widely used in desserts, cakes and pastries. This creates a complex whole of aromas and flavours, in which the acidity of the base beer is very nicely supported by the lime and cardamom and is counteracted by the sweeter mango, lactose and vanilla.
