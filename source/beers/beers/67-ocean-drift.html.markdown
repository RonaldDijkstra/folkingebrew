Always during the summer, we release a lower ABV IPA to celebrate the long, warm summer days. It's that time of year again, and we're excited to introduce Ocean Drift, a 7% Hazy IPA. Featuring all time favorite Nelson Sauvin (cryo) and Citra Cryo hops in the whirlpool, along with El Dorado, Nelson Sauvin Cryo, and Citra Cryo in the dry hop, this beer offers notes of passion fruit, gooseberry, lime, stone fruit, and pineapple.
