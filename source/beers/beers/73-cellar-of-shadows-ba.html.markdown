Aged in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels, this 13% imperial stout brings new depth and complexity to the original. The bourbon barrels lend warm notes of vanilla, caramel and subtle oak, perfectly enhancing the robust base of chocolate malt, dark malts and oats. Coconut and cocoa return to the mix delivering layers of tropical sweetness and rich dark chocolate that meld seamlessly with the barrel character.
