Enigma hops step into the spotlight in this release, showcasing a more intricate profile than Galaxy. Enigma brings a complex mix of red fruit, stone fruit, and subtle white wine-like characteristics, adding a sophisticated depth to the beer. The familiar base of Citra and Mosaic hops enhances the layered flavor, while the combination of Golden Promise, oats, and wheat provides a pillowy, smooth mouthfeel.
