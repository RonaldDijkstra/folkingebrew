Introducing our first-ever Sour IPA, "World in a World." This 7% ABV brew is a vibrant fusion of tart and fruity flavors, featuring the dynamic duo of Citra Cryo hops in the whirlpool and Citra in the dry hop stage.

Crafted with a balanced blend of pilsner malt, multiple oats, and wheat, this beer offers a smooth mouthfeel that complements its robust profile. The addition of raspberry and blueberry infuses a burst of berry goodness, while the touch of vanilla and hibiscus adds a delicate floral and sweet note.
