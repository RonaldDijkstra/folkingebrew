Crafted with care, this hazy brew showcases a selected blend of hops. We start with Cascade hops during the mash hopping stage, providing a solid foundation of bitterness with subtle hints of floral and citrus. During the whirlpool phase, we introduce Idaho 7 hops, contributing to a resinous complexity that adds depth. For the double dry hopping process, we combine the dynamic flavors of Nelson Sauvin, Mosaic, Idaho 7, and Citra, resulting in a delightful fusion of tropical fruit, juicy citrus and nuanced herbal undertones.
