For Darkest Hour (11%) the malt bill consists of two special dark malts in addition to pilsner malt, wheat and oats. After the main fermentation we added generous amounts of cocoa nibs and vanilla, so expect convincing aromas and flavors of dark chocolate and slightly sweet vanilla, on a thick body!
