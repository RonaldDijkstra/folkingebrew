For Follow the Sun, we crafted a grist with 80% pale malt and 20% rice to provide a crisp mouthfeel that complements the bold hop flavors. The combination of hot side Centennial and Citra, as well as cold side Citra, Nelson Sauvin, El Dorado and Centennial hops, creates a complex and balanced flavor profile. With each sip, you'll experience a burst of hoppy goodness, followed by a refreshing and crisp finish.
