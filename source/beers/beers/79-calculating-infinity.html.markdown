This one sits lighter than most of our hazies at 6% ABV. A deliberate choice to keep it easy while letting the hops lead. Talking about hops? Citra Cryo in the whirlpool pulls out bright citrus and soft tropical notes. The double dry hop brings El Dorado’s stone fruit, Nelson Sauvin’s white grape and another hit of Citra Cryo to tie it all together. Smooth and just bitter enough, this beer is fermented with LAIII to get that soft, full finish we want in a hazy like this.
