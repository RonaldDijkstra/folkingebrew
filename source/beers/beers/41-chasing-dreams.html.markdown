The lively blend of Motueka, Galaxy and Citra hops creates a complex flavor profile that's bursting with tropical fruit, citrus and a hint of pine. To really bring out the full potential of these hops, we've used the ever-popular London Fog yeast, which is known for its ability to create a hazy, juicy beer. We've carefully crafted the malt bill to incorporate oats and wheat, which give this DIPA a smooth and creamy mouthfeel that complements the hops beautifully.
