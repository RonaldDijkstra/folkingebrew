The hops selected for this beer, Citra, Nelson Sauvin and Idaho 7, each bring out their own notes. Citra offers citrus notes and blends harmoniously with Nelson Sauvinâ€™s nuances of white grapes and gooseberries, while Idaho 7 adds a layer of tropical fruit. What is special about this brew is that we are using Nelson Sauvin in Cryo form, which is a first for us. Cryo is a highly concentrated hop product, which brings out the fruity and white wine accents of Nelson Sauvin even more intensely.

The different hops were employed during both the whirlpool and dry-hopping phases, giving The Gathering an enticing aroma that invites, sip after sip.
