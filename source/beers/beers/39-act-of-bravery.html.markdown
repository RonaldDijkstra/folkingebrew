When talking about our collab, Bravoure’s master brewer Ric came up with the idea to make a hazy, but with a bit of a twist! Previously, he had great results with a New England White DIPA and would love to brew a beer like that with us. Obviously, we where onboard! So get to know Act of Bravery, a New England Style White DIPA (8.5% ABV)!

Now, you might ask, what makes this a New England White DIPA? Basically it’s because the use of loads of wheat in the malt bill and Belgian white beer yeast, combined with a typical New England Style yeast (in this case London Fog), for fermentation. The Wit yeast provides a base profile of banana and spices. Furthermore, the beer is double dry hopped heavily with equal doses of the infamous Southern Hemisphere hops Nelson Sauvin and Motueka and backed by Citra. This hop blend provides lots of white grape, citrus and tropical fruits in aroma and taste, which goes really well with both the yeast profiles used!
