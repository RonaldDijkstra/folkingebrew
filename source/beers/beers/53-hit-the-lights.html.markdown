During the whirlpool stage, we've harmonized Mosaic and Citra Cryo hops, carefully calibrated to deliver a balanced bitterness, adding an extra layer of complexity. However, it's during the cold side where the real enchantment unfolds. Through a triple dry-hop infusion of Mosaic (cryo), Citra (cryo and t90), and Eclipse (t90), we've orchestrated a symphony of fruity flavors that dance harmoniously on your palate.

To provide a robust foundation, we've blended Golden Promise, wheat, and an array of oats in the malt composition. This fusion imparts both body and complexity. Employing the renowned London Ale III haze yeast, we've achieved a hazy and smooth appearance that beckons you in.
