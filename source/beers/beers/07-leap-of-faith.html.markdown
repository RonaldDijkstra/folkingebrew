Leap of Faith is a New England Style DIPA of 8.5%, characterized by a solid double dry-hopping with the famous combination of Citra, Mosaic and Galaxy hops. The perfectly harmonious ratio of these hops produces delicious, balanced citrus and tropical flavours. In addition, we use a good dose of oats, so that a smooth mouth feel is created.
