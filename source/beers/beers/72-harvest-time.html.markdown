This brew is a celebration of the years of craftsmanship and experimentation that have led to this bold 10% Hazy Triple IPA! Built on a malt base of pilsner, malted oats, flaked oats, and malted wheat, this beer delivers the soft, creamy mouthfeel you know and love.

With Cryopop, Citra Cryo, Sabro, and Nelson Sauvin, the hop character is intense yet refined, bursting with tropical notes of mango, citrus, and coconut, layered with hints of white wine and gooseberry.
