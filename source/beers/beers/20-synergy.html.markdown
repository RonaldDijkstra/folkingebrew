This NEDIPA (8%) is double dry hopped with HBC 630, an experimental hop variety from the Hop Breeding Company. In addition to low color Golden Promise malt, this beer contains pilsner malt and a good amount of oats. Renowned haze yeast LAIII took care of the fermentation, so expect a real hazy New England Style DIPA.
