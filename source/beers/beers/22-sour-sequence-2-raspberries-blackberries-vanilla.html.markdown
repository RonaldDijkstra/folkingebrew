For this second edition in our Sour Sequence Series we conditioned our typically sour Berliner weisse base (8%) on hefty amounts of raspberries and blackberries. On top of that we added vanilla and lactose. This results in a deep dark hazy red sour ale with pronounced flavors and aromas of the fruits.
