Northern Lights is our next hop-forward interpretation of the New England Style Double India Pale Ale. With the creation of this DIPA, we shed light on the vibrant blend of Citra, Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy hops.

The authentic Vermont yeast and a large dose of oats work together with our massive double dry-hopping to create beautiful fruity aromas and a juicy mouthfeel. The unique properties of Nelson Sauvin come into their own particularly well and give this beer a nice crisp and fresh character.
