Only Time Will Tell is a Double IPA (8.2%) in the style that Folkingebrew has become synonymous with: fruity, hazy and intensely dry-hopped.

The blend for the double dry hopping consists of Citra, Enigma, Galaxy and El Dorado. This mix, combined with the London Ale III yeast, provides intense aromas and flavors of citrus, tropical fruit and berries. The combination of Golden Promise malt with oats guarantees the silky soft base.
