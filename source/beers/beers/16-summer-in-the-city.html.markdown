Folkingebrew ðŸ’š Groningen. Thatâ€™s why this beer Summer in the City is an ode to our beautiful city in summer time. In addition, it is an ode to two of our favorite hops: Citra and Nelson Sauvin!

In Summer in the City we used Citra Incognito as whirlpool hops. On top of that, this hazy NEIPA (7.5%) is intensely double dry hopped with Citra and Nelson Sauvin. The malt base consists of Golden Promise and various types of oats, to contribute to the silky smooth base. For the fermentation we used the IPA yeast from Verdant.
