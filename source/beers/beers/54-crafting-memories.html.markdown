In this brew, we've artfully woven the unique qualities of Talus and Citra, both in their Cryo variants, during the whirlpool stage. This pairing imparts a balanced bitterness and an extra layer of depth. Yet, the true magic unfurls during the double dry-hop. Here, Citra, Talus, and Ekuanot harmonize in a perfect blend, orchestrating a symphony of bold, fruity flavors.
